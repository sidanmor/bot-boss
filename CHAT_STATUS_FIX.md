# Enhanced GitHub Copilot Chat Status Detection

## What was fixed

The original code was not properly utilizing the GitHub Copilot extension's API. The logs showed that the extension exports contained a `getAPI` method, but the code was only looking for direct properties on the exports object.

## Changes made

1. **Added `getAPI()` method support**: The code now calls `exports.getAPI()` to get the proper Copilot API object
2. **Enhanced chat detection**: Added comprehensive chat status detection using the API object
3. **Multiple fallback methods**: If the API approach fails, it falls back to the original direct property checking
4. **Better logging**: Added detailed console logs to help debug what's happening
5. **Updated debug method**: Enhanced the `debugCopilotExtensions()` method to test the new API integration

## How to test

1. **Compile the extension**:
   ```
   npm run compile
   ```

2. **Debug the current detection**:
   Open the VS Code Developer Console (Help → Toggle Developer Tools → Console) and run:
   ```javascript
   // Get the extension instance and debug
   const ext = vscode.extensions.getExtension('your-extension-id');
   if (ext?.isActive && ext.exports) {
       const service = ext.exports.getCopilotStatusService();
       service.debugCopilotExtensions();
   }
   ```

3. **Test chat activity detection**:
   - Start a GitHub Copilot Chat session
   - Ask Copilot a question
   - While it's responding, check the console logs for chat status detection

4. **Use the test script**:
   Run the provided `test-enhanced-chat-status.js` in the VS Code Developer Console

## Expected behavior

You should now see logs like:
```
[BotBoss] Calling getAPI() to get Copilot API...
[BotBoss] Got API object: [list of API keys]
[BotBoss] Found chat object in API: [list of chat properties]
[BotBoss] Chat is actively responding
```

## Key improvements

- **Proper API usage**: Now uses the official `getAPI()` method instead of trying to access internal properties
- **Chat state detection**: Can detect when Copilot Chat is actively responding or idle
- **Better error handling**: Graceful fallbacks if API calls fail
- **Enhanced debugging**: More detailed logs to understand what's happening

The status should now properly reflect when GitHub Copilot Chat is active and responding to queries.
